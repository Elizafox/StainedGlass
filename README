StainedGlass - does what it says on the tin.

Partially based off of gotyaoi's code:

Thus portions are (C) to them.

It has been substantially reworked, in fact, it's easier to just mention what I kept from their code:
 - Some overrides are the same due to implementation being obvious/only one way to do it.
 - Kept the custom block renderer for panes. I put it in the client mod class.
 - BlockStainedPane.java is partially based on their logic for connecting and face rendering.

Thanks to @aji for helping me get bootstrapped. mkrelease.sh is almost entirely his, too.
